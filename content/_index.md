# Welcome

## Who I am

I am a Research Scientist working in the
Systems Biology Group at IBM Research in Zurich, Switzerland.

I am a theoretical
physicist by training: I studied at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon
and went on to get my PhD on particle physics at the universities of Lyon and of Louvain-la-Neuve. 
I then moved to Zurich for a postdoctoral fellowship at the ETH where
I worked on making high precision predictions in Quantum Chromodynamics for the CERN Large
Hadron Collider, in particular to help understand the precise nature of the Higgs boson.
My research covered a mixture of data analysis, experiment interpretation recasting, numerical simulations and theory.

## What I am working on

I switched to Machine Learning research in 2020 and I am focussing on diverse aspects of Robust Machine Learning, as
well as applications to the natural sciences. My current interest span uncertainty estimation, interpretability,
as well as how these topics help us understand how and when neural networks generalise.
