# Welcome

## Who I am

I am a Research Scientist working in the
Systems Biology Group at IBM Research in Zurich, Switzerland.

I am a theoretical
physicist by training: I studied at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon
and went on to get my PhD on theoretical particle physics at the universities of Lyon and of Louvain-la-Neuve. I then moved to Zurich for a postdoctoral fellowship at the ETH where
I worked on making high precision predictions in Quantum Chromodynamics for the CERN Large
Hadron Collider, in particular to help understand the precise nature of the Higgs boson.

## What I am working on

I am now transitioning into the field of machine learning applied to cancer biology. I work on interpretable and robust machine learning applications to cancer biology, in particular on single-cell and imaging mass cytometry data.
