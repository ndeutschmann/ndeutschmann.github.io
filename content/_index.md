# Welcome

## Who I am

I am a Research Scientist at IBM research in Zurich working in the
Systems Biology Group with Maria Rodriguez Martinez. 

I am a theoretical
physicist by training: I studied at the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon
and went on to get my PhD on theoretical particle physics at the universities of Lyon and of Louvain-la-Neuve. I then moved to Zurich for a postdoctoral fellowship at the ETH where
I worked on making high precision predictions in Quantum Chromodynamics for the CERN Large
Hadron Collider, in particular to help understand the precise nature of the Higgs boson.

## What I am working on

I am now transitioning into the field of machine learning applied to cancer biology. Together
with researchers from ETH Zurich and the University Hospitals in Bern and Zurich, I work new AI-powered tools to diagnose and care for colo-rectal cancer patients.
