# Research interests

I am interested in building more reliable and trustworthy deep learning predictors. My vision is that this will
ultimately be achieved by having a fine-grained and contextual understanding of generalisation, which will probably
be achieved through a combination of empirical results and theoretical work.
On the medium term, steps toward this goal should be achieved by leveraging both interpretability, to highlight 
predictive mechanisms used by models, and uncertainty estimation, which can provide great hints of what signal is being
captured by understanding what happens when a model is presented with data it is uncertain about.
