# Research interests

Most of my activity is oriented toward improving the care we provide to cancer patients by refining our understanding of molecular mechanisms that underly specific illnesses and develping novel diagnostics and prognosis tools.

My work is focused around the establishment of new interpretable AI methods based on Deep Learning to uncover the information contained in the proteome of cancer cells. I am particularly interested in predicting clinical features from ecosystems of single cells inside tumors to enable molecular-biology-powered, high-granularity diagnostic systems which could:

- be used for clinical applications in personalized medicine
- help us understand cancer better by connecting clinical data to cell-population-level information and to single-cell pictures
