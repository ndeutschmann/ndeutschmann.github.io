# Research interests

I work new AI-powered tools to diagnose and treat colo-rectal cancer patients.
In particular, I am focussing on integrating multi-modal data to predict molecular cancer subtypes
based on multi-omics and histological images.

The goal of this work is two-fold:
* Improving clinical patient stratification, which is now based on hard-to-scale genetic profiling.
* Improve our understanding of the mechanics of the disease and its response to treatments for better future care, including personalized chemotherapies.

I am working on several directions to this end:
* Advanced machine-learning models that integrate the variety of different data provided by our colleagues working in biological, pharmacological and clinical research.
* Translation of lab-built models into tools we can trust to use in hospitals. Failures should be detectable by the system or its users.
* Exploration of how we can use AI to generate new scientific knowledge through interpretability and model-informed machine-learning.
