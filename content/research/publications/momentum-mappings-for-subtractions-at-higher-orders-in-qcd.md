Subtraction schemes provide a systematic way to compute fully-differential cross sections beyond the leading order in the strong coupling constant. These methods make singular real-emission corrections integrable in phase space by the addition of suitable counterterms. Such counterterms may be defined using momentum mappings, which are parametrisations of the phase space that factorise the variables that describe the particles becoming unresolved in some infrared or collinear limit from the variables that describe an on-shell phase space for the resolved particles. In this work, we review existing momentum mappings in a unified framework and introduce new ones for final-collinear and soft counterterms. The new mappings work in the presence of massive particles and with an arbitrary number of soft particles or of clusters of collinear particles, making them fit for subtraction methods at any order in â€¦
