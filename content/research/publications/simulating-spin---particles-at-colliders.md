Support for interactions of spin-                                             3/2 particles is implemented in the FeynRules and ALOHA packages and tested with the MadGraph 5 and CalcHEP event generators in the context of three phenomenological applications. In the first, we implement a spin-                                             3/2 Majorana gravitino field, as in local supersymmetric models, and study â€¦
