We study the production of a Higgs boson in association with bottom quarks in hadronic collisions at the LHC, including the different contributions stemming from terms proportional to the top-quark Yukawa coupling (y 2 t), to the bottom-quark one (y 2 b), and to their interference (y b y t). Our results are accurate to next-to-leading order in QCD, employ the four-flavour scheme and the (Born-improved) heavy-top quark approximation. We find that next-to-leading order corrections to the y 2 t component are sizable, making it the dominant production mechanism for associated production in the Standard Model and increasing its inclusive rate by almost a factor of two. By studying final-state distributions of the various contributions, we identify observables and selection cuts that can be used to select the various components and to improve the experimental sensitivity of production on the bottom-quark Yukawa â€¦
