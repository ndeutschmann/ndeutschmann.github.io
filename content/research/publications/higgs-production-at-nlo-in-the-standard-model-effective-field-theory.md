The Effective Field Theory approach is a fruitful way of constraining new physics in a model independent way. As the Higgs sector is one of the most popular candidate for deviations from the Standard Model, it is particularly important that the constraints extracted from the experimental data on the Higgs boson be as meaningful as possible, which entails making accurate and precise theoretical predictions.
